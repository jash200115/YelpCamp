* After registering you are good to go , you can add your own campground and view others also and make your reviews.
* To view all Campgrounds just click on View Campground (On Home Page) or on the Campgrounds (in navbar).
* Here is a quick preview of what you are about to see.

* On Top of the All Campgrounds map you can see a map , showing all the campground entries in the YelpCamp website in a form of clusters, if you zoom into them they become unclustered and you can go to that particular campground page just by clicking the unclustered point on map.
* To show you how it works here is a quick demo.

* Another way of viewing campground is to select from all campgrounds list and click on view campground button.
* After clicking you are now in the campround page where you can read about that Campground Place and go through all the images. If you want to know that exact campground location you can also view it on the map that is given beside.

* You can see others reviews on that place and make your reviews too. You may also edit your review but remember you can edit or delete only your reviews not others.
* If you want to add your campground to the website you can do so by clicking on "New Campgroun" (on the navbar). It will redirect you to the page New Campground.
